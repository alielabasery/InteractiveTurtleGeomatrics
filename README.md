# InteractiveTurtleGeomatrics
An interactive program utilizing the Turtle graphics library to draw circles, lines, and their intersections on a coordinate plane. 
The user is presented with a menu that offers options to draw circles and lines, change colors, or exit the program.
The code incorporates error handling to guide the user back to the menu in case of invalid inputs or errors during the drawing process. 
The primary features include drawing geometric shapes, calculating intersections, and providing a user-friendly menu system, while the main functionality for the code remains to draw circles and calculate any intersections.
